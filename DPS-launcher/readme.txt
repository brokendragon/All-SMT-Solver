Before compiling:
1. You have to change the path "E:\project\Program_Analysis\z3_program\CNS\programs\tclap-1.2.1\include\tclap\CmdLine.h" to the corresponding path of tclap.
2. We use tclap-1.2.1 to parse command line.
3. TIME_OUT, MEMORY_OUT, and so on are set by specifying command line.

After compiling:
1. Rename the output executable as "launcher.exe"
2. Please make sure that "dynamicAsChild.exe" is in the same folder.
